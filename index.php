	<h3>Project Description</h3>
	<p>This project will consist of a working interactive website with a simple, meaningful GUI for users to play through games. 
	The web page is in html with php functionality, and it will have a supporting database for storing monster and character information. 
	The game itself is a “choose your own adventure” style game, where the user is presented with a portion of a story, and depending on their choice when prompted, 
	the story will go in one of multiple directions. This particular story is about a monster chase, so occasionally in the story the user will encounter a monster and enter a 1v1 fight.</p>
