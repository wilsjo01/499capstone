You make your way over to the cafeteria which still appears to be open. There are a few people sitting around tables eating dinner and a person behind the counter. You go over to him and ask about a glowing red orb. He looks at you in a puzzled way and asks if you are going to order anything.

He seems to think you're a bit crazy.
