You crack the door open to the Dean's Office, when there on the top of the desk is a small, glowing orb very similar to the one that the Wizard had transformed out from. You grab the orb and the inner voice of the Wizard tells you to hurry back to him.

You cross the street and go back into the garage, where the wizard is waiting. He turns to you and smiles. You are both relieved and curious as you hand the orb to him.

He takes the orb, and looks at it. He smiles and looks back at you. Something is wrong.

"Foolish child" he says. "You have given me the full power to bring forth the rest of my creatures to your world. But, do not fear. Once the invasion begins, I will spare you and you will serve me and my creatures for eternity. You will do my laundry, you will wash my dishes and you will fold my clothes for the rest of your days. You should have listened to your parents and gone right to meet your chaperone, but I thank you just the same for all of your help. Now, time to change into your new clothes! Hahaha!"

The sky begins to crackle with energy and your clothes turn into rags. The Wizard was not who he seemed to be and has tricked you!
