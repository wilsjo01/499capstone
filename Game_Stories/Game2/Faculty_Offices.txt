You come up to the Faculty Offices, nearly out of breath. You walk inside and begin to search high and low for the orb. You try desk drawers, mailboxes and cabinets. All of them come up empty. You slump into a chair with a sigh and think that you may never find the orb and perhaps you should have simply gone to meet Kate and forgotten the wizard completely.


Just then, you hear the wizard speak to you. It seems like he wants you to try the Dean’s Office.

Do you want to follow the Wizard’s instruction and try the Dean’s Office?
