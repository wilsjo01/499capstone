You arrive for your first night of college week, hoping you are not late. College week is a program put on by your grade school to orient you to college life. You have been assigned a student who attends the college. Her name is Katie Allen. The slip of paper in your pocket says you need to meet her at the admissions desk, just inside and your parents are to pick you up at about 8PM. You begin to make your way down the stairs of the garage as you notice a small, glowing ball of light. It seems to want you to follow it.

You round a corner to a point of the stairwell where it stops. The light begins to transform into a man, tall with a white beard and pointy hat. The man speaks to you. He says:

"Ulfbert is my name. Thank you for meeting with me. Your curiosity is just what I need. 

I have been trapped in this form for so long, waiting for someone like you to follow me to this spot. You see, I can only connect with this world of yours through this very spot for some reason. Perhaps the energies are stronger here. But, no matter. I need your help. 

I am not the only one who has found his way into your world. Monsters of all types and sizes have begun to use the energies that this very university has been sitting on to bring themselves in too. These creatures are very dangerous and, should you decide to help me, we can bring them back to where they came from and seal the door forever. I need you to find and bring me some things. Will you help?"
