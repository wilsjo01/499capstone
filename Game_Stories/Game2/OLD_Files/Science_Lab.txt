You check out the Science Lab. You think that since this orb is made up of some sort of energy, it might be drawn to the sciences. Seems to make sense in your mind.

You begin checking the rooms and notice a small glow in the corner of one of them. COuld it be the orb??

You hurry over to it and peer over the edge of a lab table. It’s only a reflection from the exit sign above you. You sigh and slump back onto a stool. You put your elbow up on the table, but have knocked over a beaker full of a light green powder. POOF!

It swirls in a small tornado of colors and begins to take shape.

You’re running out of time. The Wizard seems to compel you to the Dean’s Office. You are out of other ideas so you comply.

Head to the Dean’s Office
