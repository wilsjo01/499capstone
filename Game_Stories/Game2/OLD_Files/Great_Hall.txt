You cross the walkway back over to try looking in the Great Hall. As you make your way up the stairs, you hear some rumbling. You keep going up, carefully, and peer around the corner into the hallway. There, stands a real ghoulish figure and it seems to be...eating something. You don’t see an orb, but need to get by this thing and get to the other side. 

Carefully, you take each step hoping not to make a sound. One foot and then another. You’re almost there.

Then, a peel of lightning cracks outside just over your shoulder. The monster swings around and turns to you. It’s too late, it has seen you now…
