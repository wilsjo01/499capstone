“I must be losing my mind” you tell this strange wizardly figure as you start walking fast out the door. Outside, you spring across the street and find your way into the Admissions Office. Katie is waiting for you there, just as you had expected. 

“Boy, am I glad to see you!”, you exclaim and begin to tell her what happened out in the parking lot. She will never believe me, though, is your only thought.

“What happened?” she asks.

“Nothing, nevermind” you reply as you begin to ready yourself for your time with Katie, hoping she asks no more questions about it and you can put it behind you.

You did not help the wizard. THE END.
