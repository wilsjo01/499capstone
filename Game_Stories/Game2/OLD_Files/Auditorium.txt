You continue on to the Auditorium, hoping to find the orb. It still sticks in your your mind that you don’t know why you’re getting this orb for the wizard to begin with, but you feel his presence urging you to check the auditorium. It somehow connects to your brain, telling you what to do without you hearing a sound. It is a strange feeling.

The door to the auditorium is open and you step inside. It is dark in there and you try to find the lights. You make your way to the seats and begin to follow the rows, hoping to get to the other wall where a light switch may be. 

You follow the rows with your fingers when the rows don’t feel like seats anymore. They feel like a disgusting ooze. A loud roar has the hair on your neck stand on end.

You reel back, preparing to defend yourself…

FIGHT

The orb is not here, where to next?
