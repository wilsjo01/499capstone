Down the hallway to the IT Department, you find nothing out of the ordinary. The IT Desk has a young man sitting inside. You begin to ask if he has seen any glowing, red orbs, but realize this sounds a bit ridiculous. Instead you ask if heï¿½s seen anything strange. 

He tells you it has been pretty quiet. "What do you mean strange," he inquires as a quizzical look falls on his face.

"Oh, nothing" you reply as you exit the door.

It doesn't seem to be here. Where do you want to go next?
