Concordia University seems like it would be a good place to look. You head down there, sprinting for all of your worth, stopping at the doors to catch your breath. You reach out and grab the handle. Locked. You keep checking the doors, one by one, none of them are open. You decide you can either try to break a window and search here, or just keep moving. Your lungs plead with you to stay, but your head wins the battle and pushes you forward. 

Where would you like to go next?
