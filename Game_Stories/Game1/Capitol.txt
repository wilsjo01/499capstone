The State Capitol makes the most sense. It’s just down the street from you and has probably more history to it than any other building you can think of. As you walk up the front lawn, you see some lights inside the building, but not from any electrical outlet. This light is eerie and a light blue in color. It seems to swirl back and forth through the halls. 

You enter through the front door and begin checking desks and anything you can find that might hold the key, keeping in mind the cell in which Horace Stanley is kept. Suddenly, through the hall, the blue light shoots right at you. You can’t make out any sort of body, only that it is a light. You run from the building before it gets any closer and down the lawn. Better keep moving if you are going to make it in time before the sunrise.

Where to next?
