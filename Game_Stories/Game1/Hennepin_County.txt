You need to hurry now as you are getting close to Target Field and still haven't found the key or Horace Stanley. The Hennepin County Government Center might be a good place to look. You break open a side window and make your way inside. A creature immediately takes you by surprise. Staring into its eyes, you slowly back away, gripped by fear. High above you, a chandelier begins to sway under the weighted footsteps of the monster. The chain breaks and it falls directly on the monster's head. You make a hasty retreat and run for your life. 

Where are you running to next?
