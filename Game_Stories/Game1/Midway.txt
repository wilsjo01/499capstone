The Midway Marketplace might hold some answers as to where you can find the key or the cell where Horace Stanley is being held. You enter the grounds and sigh as you see many different trailers where food vendors peddle their wares. You begin searching through them, one by one, hoping to find some clues. You pull the door open of what seems like your millionth trailer and something jumps out at you! Startled, you slip from the trailer stairs and fall back & hit your head. The beast closes in on you and lookging to finish you off. 

You must defend yourself against the beast of the Marketplace...
