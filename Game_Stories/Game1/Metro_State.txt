You awaken in a room that is dark. Looking around, you find many books, possibly a library. You begin to search around, feeling with your hands as the room is too dim to search with your eyes. You come across a small piece of paper. You use the flashlight on your phone to help you to see your surroundings as you turn your attention to the piece of paper. It reads:

“Traveler,

I am Horace Stanley, professional exorcist and chief ghost hunter at Horace and Sons, Incorporated. I need your help. One hundred and three years ago, my great grandfather was a ghost hunter like me. He stumbled upon an ancient tome in the deserts of Africa near modern-day Egypt. The tome held secrets of mathematics and sciences far beyond its time. Over time, a mysterious glow had begun to develop around the book. My great grandfather had asked several scientists and archeologists what was causing this glow, but none of them could see it. Late one night, he stole the tome from the building where it was held, and following the instructions, broke its seal. The book flew open as spirits and ghosts from every realm came forth. We had been hunting them ever since, hoping one day to restore the spirits to the tome and seal it forever. We had our task near completion, when the mad scientist Dr. Gerry WattShock convinced a court of law that this was a dangerous artifact and needed to be placed in the care of the Greater Twin Cities Society of Historical Artifacts. Not knowing what the book was capable of, Dr. WattShock became mad, much in the same way as my great grandfather and had reopened the tome to release the spirits we had worked so hard to capture. We have discovered a way to bring them to the tome, much like a beacon of sorts, that simply draws the spirits to it to be captured, but we need to do some things first. I need a relic, a key that fits into a hidden pocket of the tome. Once we have found the key, the tome must be placed in the same area where the seal was broken to begin with. On the site of what is now Target Field in Minneapolis. To become a homing beacon, it needs to be placed here first before the key is inserted. Also, I would appreciate it if you could free me from this cell. I have been taken somewhere along the University Avenue corridor, but am unsure what building it is in. Search these buildings for myself and the key, and try to stick with buildings with a lot of history. For some reason, they are drawn to the stonework there.

You scramble to your feet and begin looking for a door, using your flashlight to light the way. As you make your way outside, you realize you are in St. Paul at Metropolitan State University. You begin to walk towards the capitol building and University Avenue. It’s going to be a long night.

Where would you like to travel to look first?
