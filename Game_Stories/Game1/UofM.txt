You have made it to the medical center. It is a welcome sight as you search for the key and any sign of Horace Stanley. Along the way, you pick up some much needed medical supplies. You apply some of them to a cut you received from a chain link fence coming inside. You pack a few more in case you encounter anything unusual. 

There is no sign of Horace or a key. You press on. 

Where to next?
