The elevators don't work and neither do the lights of the Foshay Tower as you begin to climb the stairs. You wonder to yourself if you will ever find the key or Horace Stanley. Just then, you hear cries for help down the hall on the second floor. Is it him you wonder. You kick down the door. It is Horace. He doesn't look human, but rather... ghostly. He smiles at you, teeth rotten and missing. He closes in on you as you slowly back away.

Prepare to defend yourself...
