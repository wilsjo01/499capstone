Target Field is the place where the book released its power in the first place and maybe it could at least hold a clue to where the key and Horace Stanley are hiding. You run down the entrance tunnel to the field. It's is nearly dawn. 

Upon entering the field, you see your suspicions were right. There at home plate stands the evil Dr. WattShock. The book is in his hand and the key draped neatly around his neck. He tells you of his plan to reverse the spell and open the book forever as bits of lightning crackle around his form. He is planning to release minions untold, stronger and more evil than those already in the world. You must stop him. You race towards him ready to do battle. He smirks and readies himself for victory or failure.
