You decide to go try McNally Smith College of Music first. It seems like a logical choice since it is close by. You creep up the stairs to a side door that has been boarded up. Luckily, the boards have been broken through and you are able to squeeze through the opening. Once inside, you begin searching for any signs of life. Nothing. You spend less than an hour here before you decide you have to keep moving.

Where would you like to go next?
